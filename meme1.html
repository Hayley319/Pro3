    <div class="meme-title">J.D. Vance Killed the Pope</div>

    <div class="meme-text">
      <p>Pope Francis died this week at age 88. Some now joke that U.S. VP J.D. Vance caused it.</p>
      <p>He had just met with the Pope before his death. That timing led to dark, funny theories.</p>
      <p>Memes began calling Vance the antichrist, or saying his vibe alone was fatal.</p>
      <p>People edited him with a scythe, or said the Pope died of cringe. Either way, it blew up.</p>
      <p>Vance’s meme legacy lives on, now tied to both politics and mortality.</p>

    <div class="meme-title">Trisha Paytas' Baby Reincarnations</div>
    <div class="meme-images">

    </div>
    <div class="meme-text">
      <p>This meme started in 2022 when Trisha Paytas had a baby right as Queen Elizabeth died.</p>
      <p>The joke? That powerful people are reincarnated as Paytas’ babies.</p>
      <p>It returned in 2024 when King Charles got sick, and now again with the Pope’s death.</p>
      <p>People think it’s funny, weird, and very internet. It’s basically a digital folktale.</p>
      <p>This time, the timing doesn’t quite work. But the joke lives on anyway.</p>
