      <p>Pope Francis died early this week at the ripe old age of 88, and in an unexpected turn of events, people are pointing the blame at U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the Pope was pronounced dead not even a day after he was seen meeting with Vance. This got some people theorizing that maybe, just maybe, J.D. Vance is the antichrist, and it was this meeting that resulted in the death of Pope Francis.</p>
      <p>The timing of the two events was just too juicy for people to resist, resulting in a massive wave of memes about Vance's death touch.</p>
      <p>One viral example shows Vance with a demonic look on his face, brandishing a scythe. Another offers an alternative hypothesis that Pope Francis died of cringe after meeting Vance, which is a theory that can't be totally discounted.</p>
      <p>Whatever the case, Vance just can't seem to avoid being a meme as those viral face edits continue to haunt him on the timeline alongside the Pope memes.</p>

    <div class="meme-text">
      <p>The death of Pope Francis didn't just give us a killer new J.D. Vance meme, it also revived a beloved old meme and humorous theory about powerful people being reincarnated as influencer Trisha Paytas' babies.</p>
      <p>The meme originally went viral in 2022, surrounding the death of Queen Elizabeth. At the time, Paytas was set to have her first baby. While the due date didn't match up exactly with the queen's death date, it was close enough to inspire memes about the queen coming back in the form of the wee baby Malibu Barbie.</p>
      <p>The meme made a big comeback in 2024 when King Charles fell ill. People assumed he was going to die and, coincidentally, Paytas was pregnant with her second baby that year.</p>
      <p>Now, the meme is back thanks to the death of the pope and the fact that Paytas is pregnant with her third baby. Unfortunately, the meme is a little forced this time around, as the due date for baby number three is still pretty far off, according to Paytas.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, that leaves people a good few months to find another dying monarch or holy person to link to the new baby.</p>

      <p>A VRChat avatar named Lapwing took Twitter/X by storm this week for her impressive face tracking software and waifu-ability.</p>
      <p>The character has been available to VRChat users since 2023, but only just hit people's radar when a video showcasing her new face tracking software went viral. The tracking software is very impressive, especially with how accurately it seems to capture emotions.</p>
      <p>However, many viewers found themselves more captivated with the model herself, resulting in a flurry of fan art and memes that have been just about inescapable by the average X user all week.</p>
      <p>Most of the content centered on Lapwing is fan art, depicting her in a variety of styles and striking some of the emotions shown in the tech demo. Others are posting memes, including a lot of memes that refer to her as Gosling after Ryan Gosling.</p>
      <p>Specifically, they're referencing the "You Look Lonely" meme as a way of wishing that Lapwing was a real woman. Keep dreaming, VRChatters.</p>

  <!-- SUMMARY -->
  <section class="summary-section">
    <div class="summary-title">üìù Weekly Meme Summary</div>
    <div class="summary-text">
      <p>This week‚Äôs memes form a strangely poetic arc ‚Äî from religious death conspiracies, to cosmic influencer reincarnations, and finally to longing for digital love. They‚Äôre chaotic, yes ‚Äî but they tell a story about how the internet processes power, emotion, and identity.</p>
      <p>It began with ‚ÄúJ.D. Vance Killed the Pope,‚Äù a meme fueled by eerie timing: the Pope‚Äôs death just hours after a meeting with U.S. Vice President Vance. Internet logic took over, and soon Vance was reimagined as a reaper, an antichrist, or just a really bad vibe. It‚Äôs a joke, of course ‚Äî but like all good political memes, it masks real discomfort with how detached and ominous political figures can feel.</p>
      <p>Then came the return of an old favorite: Trisha Paytas‚Äô Baby Reincarnations. With Paytas expecting her third child and the Pope freshly departed, the internet couldn‚Äôt resist reviving the meme that started when Queen Elizabeth died in 2022 ‚Äî that powerful figures are being reincarnated as her babies. It‚Äôs absurd, morbidly funny, and deeply internet-brained ‚Äî our collective way of making sense of time, cycles, and celebrity through chaotic myth-making.</p>
      <p>But it‚Äôs Lapwing / Gosling who gives this week its emotional weight ‚Äî and maybe even a bit of hope. A VRChat waifu with shockingly smooth facial tracking, Lapwing captured hearts for more than just her tech. People weren‚Äôt just impressed ‚Äî they were moved. They projected loneliness, tenderness, and even romantic longing onto a digital avatar. The flood of memes and fan art wasn‚Äôt just about ‚Äúhow real she looks,‚Äù but how real she feels.</p>
      <p>From death memes to rebirth jokes, and finally to digital intimacy, this week‚Äôs memes show a generation that is constantly processing the surreal ‚Äî not by escaping it, but by memeing through it.</p>
